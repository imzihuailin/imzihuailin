# Hi, I’m Zihuailin 👋

🌱 I’m a high school student in China who believes that **self-teaching** is the most powerful skill anyone can build.
💡 I see school not as the end, but as the training ground to become **an independent thinker and doer**.

### 🧠 My Values

* **Sleep > Exercise > Relaxing > Learning > Work > Everything Else**
* I believe only *producers* truly create value. That’s why I aim to **build, teach, and invest**.
* I don’t just want to "make it" — I want to **accumulate meaningful wealth**, the kind that supports family and friends.

### 🛠️ What I’m Learning

* 🐍 Python (yes, I read the original tutorial in English)
* 📘 Books like *Animal Farm* and *Fooled by Randomness* (self-read, no class involved)
* 📚 I study English by *using* it, not memorizing it
* 💸 I’ve read the Bitcoin Whitepaper many times and even invest in a Bitcoin-related ETF
* 🤖 I can use ChatGPT fluently and often explore how to apply it in learning, productivity, and creative work
* 💡 I also dive into topics like economics, Bitcoin, cognitive science, and productivity

### 📌 Projects & Interests

* Building study tools for efficient error review and spaced repetition
* Exploring AI in medicine and learning systems
* Dreaming up ideas for future startups in Hangzhou

### ⚙️ Tools I Use

`Python` `LaTeX` `Git` `Markdown` `VS Code`
And my favorite: **curiosity and persistence**.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect

* I love deep conversations about tech, learning, society, and how to live a better life.
* If you care about building meaningful things and constantly improving, we’ll probably get along.
